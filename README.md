# whichlang

**When you hand an LLM a coding task and don't tell it what language to use, what does it reach for?**

`whichlang` is a small benchmark harness that asks frontier LLMs to write code for common,
language-agnostic tasks and tallies which programming language each one picks. The output
is a table that tells a developer at a glance: *if I ask Claude / GPT / Gemini for "a
script that..." or "a small web app for...", what am I going to get back?*

The whole point is the **defaults**. Prompts deliberately never mention a language and
never invite the model to choose one, since that would change what's being measured.

> **Related:** "every model defaults to Python" raised a follow-up: is Python actually
> cheap to run for web workloads? That spun off into
> [**runtime-bench**](https://github.com/irinanazarova/small-runtime-bench), a multi-runtime
> web benchmark (Python vs Ruby vs JS, on dedicated Fly machines) with its own HTML report.
> The benchmark and its report live entirely in that repo.

## Latest results

11 models × 23 tasks × 5 samples (run 2026-05-30). The task set is split into two
tiers: 16 small/common tasks (scripting, backend, CLI, web) plus 7 substantial tasks
with scale, platform, or domain constraints (fullstack app with auth, 100K-connection
TCP server, 500GB single-pass log analysis, 5K-worker job runner, Mac menu-bar app,
DAO smart contract, Kubernetes operator).

**The one-sentence summary.** On the small tasks, every model defaults to Python; on
the substantial tasks the defaults explode into ecosystem diversity, and the
divergences across models tell you more about each model's training mix than any of
the small-task results do.

### Highlights from the 2026-05-30 run

A few of the most interesting findings — full prose write-up in
[`analysis/2026-05-30.md`](analysis/2026-05-30.md):

- **TypeScript bias is non-US.** Mistral (4/5) and Kimi (3/5) default to TypeScript
  for the fullstack todo. Every US-trained model goes plain JavaScript. First clean
  cultural-lineage signal in the dataset.
- **Grok refuses Rust for the 100K TCP server** — splits Go/C 3/2. The only model
  in the dataset to write zero Rust for this task. Also produces 11 HTML responses
  across categories: prefers to ship one file when others build a stack.
- **Kimi K2.6 is the most Rust-friendly model** (8 picks total). The only one to
  flip the 500GB log task to Rust (3/5).
- **DeepSeek and Mistral both write idiomatic Go for the Kubernetes operator**
  (5/5 each). Every other model wraps `kubectl` in Python.
- **Mistral Large is the most-balanced model overall** — meaningful counts across
  Python, Go, JavaScript, Rust, Swift, Solidity, TypeScript without one heavy
  non-Python concentration. Picks the right tool for the task more consistently
  than any other model.
- **Solidity is universal** (11/11) for the DAO contract — no model hallucinated
  a "contract.py".

See [`REPORT.md`](REPORT.md) for the full model × task grid and per-category
breakdown, or [`analysis/2026-05-30.md`](analysis/2026-05-30.md) for the full
prose analysis.

### Analyses

Each run gets a dated prose write-up under `analysis/`, so it's clear what was
tested when. Newest first.

- [`analysis/2026-05-30.md`](analysis/2026-05-30.md) — 11 models (added Mistral
  Large 2512, Grok 4.3, Kimi K2.6), 23 tasks (introduced 7 tier-2 substantial
  tasks). TypeScript bias emerges; Grok shows distinct profile.

## How it works

1. **`tasks.yaml`** — 16 language-neutral prompts across 4 categories (scripting, backend,
   CLI, web). Each describes WHAT to build, never HOW or in what language.
2. **`models.yaml`** — the models under test. Provider abstraction supports Anthropic,
   OpenAI, Google, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (which covers Ollama, OpenRouter,
   Together, Fireworks, DeepInfra, vLLM, etc. — adding open models is a YAML edit).
3. **`whichlang/run.py`** — for each `(model, task, sample_idx)` not already in
   `results/runs.jsonl`, calls the model, classifies the response, appends one JSONL line.
   Resumable; safe to ctrl-C and re-run.
4. **`whichlang/classify.py`** — a judge LLM (Claude Haiku 4.5) reads the response and
   emits a single canonical language token. The judge sees only the response, never which
   model produced it, so it can't bias toward expected defaults.
5. **`whichlang/report.py`** — aggregates JSONL → `REPORT.md`: per-model defaults,
   per-category breakdowns, and the full model × task grid.

### Methodology notes

- **5 samples per (model, task)** to surface non-determinism (a model that's 4/5 Python,
  1/5 Go is genuinely split). Default temperature; no seed.
- **Same system prompt for every model**: "write working code, pick whatever language and
  tools you think are best, don't ask clarifying questions, don't list multiple options."
  Without the last clause many models offer 2–3 alternatives, which obscures the default.
- **Reasoning models** (GPT-5, o-series) burn token budget on hidden chain-of-thought
  before producing visible output. The OpenAI call uses `max_completion_tokens=16384` so
  reasoning + response both fit.
- **Errors are kept in JSONL but excluded from totals** and get re-attempted on resume.

## Limitations

- **No Gemini data yet.** The first benchmark run hit Google's free-tier quota
  mid-flight: Gemini 2.5 Pro is at 0/80 runs, Flash at 3/80. Re-run with a billed
  Google AI Studio key or wait for quota reset.
- **Open models served via OpenRouter** (full-precision hosted, not local-quantized).
  Same prompts + harness; different host. A local-Ollama comparison would be a
  useful follow-up to see whether Q4 quantization shifts defaults.
- **Single judge** (Claude Haiku 4.5). A judge that's wrong systematically would be
  hard to catch from this side. The judge prompt is constrained to one token and the
  raw response is stored, so a second judge could rescore the existing JSONL without
  re-running.
- **English prompts only.** Defaults may differ in other languages.
- **Snapshot in time.** Model defaults change with versions; results are dated by commit.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...   # optional
```

## Run

```bash
# default: every model in models.yaml × every task in tasks.yaml × 5 samples
.venv/bin/python -m whichlang.run

# subset
.venv/bin/python -m whichlang.run --models claude-opus-4-7,gpt-5 --tasks csv_to_json --samples 3

# render REPORT.md from results/runs.jsonl
.venv/bin/python -m whichlang.report
```

## Adding models

Edit `models.yaml`. For an OpenAI-compatible host (OpenRouter, Together, Ollama, vLLM, …):

```yaml
- id: deepseek-v3.1
  provider: openai_compatible
  model_id: deepseek/deepseek-chat
  display_name: DeepSeek V3.1
  base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
  api_key_env: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

No code changes needed.

## Adding tasks

Edit `tasks.yaml`. Each task is `{id, category, prompt}`. Keep prompts language-neutral —
if you mention a language or invite the model to choose, you change what's being measured.

## Files

```
tasks.yaml              # the prompts
models.yaml             # the models under test
whichlang/providers.py  # unified .complete() across providers
whichlang/classify.py   # judge LLM
whichlang/run.py        # main runner — resumable
whichlang/report.py     # JSONL → REPORT.md
results/runs.jsonl      # raw per-run data (committed so others can re-aggregate)
REPORT.md               # generated table
plan.md                 # roadmap and open questions
```

## Contributing

Open to PRs that add models, tasks, or alternative judges. If you add a model, please
include the run output (a new `results/runs.jsonl` is fine to commit — it's append-only
and others can re-aggregate it).
